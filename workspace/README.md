# Predictive Modeling for Agriculture

This project aims to leverage data science and machine learning techniques to improve agricultural outcomes. It provides tools and models for analyzing soil measures and predicting crop yields based on available data.

## Project Structure

- `farmer_in_a_field.jpg`: Sample image related to agriculture.
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing data analysis, modeling, and visualization code.
- `soil_measures.csv`: Dataset with soil measurements for analysis and modeling.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/kinola-IQ/Predictive-Modeling-for-Agriculture.git
   ```
2. **Open the project in VS Code**
3. **Install dependencies**
   - Open `notebook.ipynb` and install required Python packages (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) if prompted.

## Usage

- Explore the `notebook.ipynb` for step-by-step data analysis and predictive modeling.
- Use the provided dataset (`soil_measures.csv`) for your own experiments.
