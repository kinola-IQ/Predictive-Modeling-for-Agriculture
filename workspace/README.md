# Predictive Modeling for Agriculture

This project aims to leverage data science and machine learning techniques to improve agricultural outcomes. It provides tools and models for analyzing soil measures and predicting crop yields, with a focus on practical applications for farmers and agronomists.

## Project Structure
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing data analysis, modeling, and visualization steps.
- `soil_measures.csv`: Dataset with soil measurements used for analysis and modeling.
- `farmer_in_a_field.jpg`: Sample image for documentation or visualization purposes.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and instructions.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Open `notebook.ipynb`** in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. **Install required Python packages** (see below).
4. **Run the notebook cells** to explore data and build predictive models.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
- Recommended packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Usage
- Analyze soil data from `soil_measures.csv`.
- Build and evaluate predictive models for agricultural insights.
- Visualize results and interpret findings for decision-making.
